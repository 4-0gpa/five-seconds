# Backend code

Contains the actual backend code.

# Setup

* `cd` into the backend directory
* Create a virtual environment with the command `virtualenv env`
* Run the environment with...
    * Mac: `source env/bin/activate`
    * Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
    * Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
* Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the Flask server with `flask --app hello run`
    * Do ensure you have in fact `cd`ed into the correct directory as running Flask with `python` or `python3` will not work
